                About Me
            </h3>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Birmingham and 
                studied Mechanical Engineering at Sheffield university.
            </p>
            <P>
                After uni I worked a few typical office jobs and spent a few some years in the
                energy industry. Despite my hard work I really felt like I was going nowhere
                and knew I needed a change of career.
                I've always been interested in technology and how things work, I love
                playing games and solving problems. After a bit of soul searching I decided
                to try my hand at building websites - a medium through which
                I can exercise my creativity and problem solving and find a challenging
                and satisfying career.
            </P>
            <p>
                While I still have some distance to go before becoming a fully fledged web developer,
                I have never been more determined to make a success of myself.
                This is a brand new chapter in my life and I'm feeling excited and optimistic.
